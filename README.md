# Alma: A Dementia-Friendly AI Companion

## Why Alma?

As people age, some experience cognitive decline that affects their ability to communicate and remember important details. Caregivers and family members often struggle to provide continuous support while ensuring their loved ones remain engaged and safe. 

**Alma** is designed as a **conversational AI companion** to help dementia patients feel more connected while giving caregivers tools to track changes in communication patterns.

## Future Plans
- **Speech-to-Text Support** 🎙️ for voice interactions.
- **Long-Term Memory Recall** 📚 for more personalized conversations.
- **Advanced NLP Models** 🤖 for improved engagement.

---

## Considerations
- **Data Security**: Patient logs are encrypted and access is restricted.  
- **Responsible AI**: Responses are designed to be **clear and non-misleading**.  
- **Caregiver Support**: Alma is **not a replacement for human care** but a tool to assist caregivers.
